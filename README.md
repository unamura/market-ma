# Market Ma

## Web app to check the weather

The project aims to be a simple shop listing for items.

## How it works


### Docker
I added a Dockerfile to build an image to build a container that allows to run
 the app without installing java or other tools. The image first install mvn and
 then compile the package inside the container to run it later.

### Steps
- [ ] Retrieve a place by the name
- [ ] Visualize important weather data for the place written
- [ ] Creating an API
- [ ] Add a Dockerfile to build a Docker image
- [ ] Making available the application.yml
